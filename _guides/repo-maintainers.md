## Main README page

#### Sections: 

- Main info

This section provides a quick summary of what's in the repository and main folders.

- Meeting Schedule

This section lists (only) upcoming meetings - the next ~three are shown in the main page and the remainder are "hidden" in a details HTML block. 

Presenters are encouraged to make PRs to this section to sign up by adding their name to a chapter (and possibly a link to their Twitter handle or other website if desired).

Names and links are moved to the Presentations/Recordings section after the meeting is complete and annotated with links to slides, video etc. 

- Presentations and Recordings

This section lists presentations and recordings for each chapter, indexed by chapter.

Fully reproducible slides (ie RMDs + data + supporting JS/CSS libs etc, but also possibly PPTX) should be uploaded to the `Presentations` folder. The linked slides should be hosted via an R4DS GH Pages link built on the actual repository (and not at a fork of the repository). 

Videos should be recordings hosted on the R4DS Youtube.
